The subscribable alerts system

What? Why?
----------

Subscribe to alerts. No reason whatsoever - just some coding fun :)

Tell me more...
---------------

An example is best:

 - You create a new alerts node, e.g. "ACME colleagues after-work drinks".
 - You send an invite to people you think may be interested in the alerts, e.g. your ACME colleagues.
 - They choose their method of being alerted, e.g. email, a tweet, etc.
 - Whenever someone sends a message to the node, everyone will get the broadcast.
 - A suitable example of a message, in this case: "Hey guys, drinks tonight is at Al's".

Getting started
---------------

OK, now I'm getting way ahead of myself. Code to follow :)
